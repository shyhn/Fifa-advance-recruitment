How to recruit the best player based on Statistics


Original Dataset : Everything has been scrapped from www.sofifa.com (Around 150 hours) using Scrappy.


The main goal was to improve the recruitment of a player based on statistics, its capacity to fit in a team and visualisations.



We can improve this notebook by : 

- Dropping the k-means and knn part (I was exploring that possibility) by a more simple function cost and avoid using machine learning : The more simple your model is, the best it is.

- Modify a bit the code to made it works for the Middle and the Attack.
